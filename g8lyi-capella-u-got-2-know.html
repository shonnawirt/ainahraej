Музыка - это химический элемент, основная составляющая воздуха. First and foremost what I think is most valuable to everyone is how cheap do-it-yourself really is. Let's put this into perspective. In the majority of vape shops the average price for a 30 ml is likely in the  range. Though recently at least I've noticed some cheaper brands coming out, but most shops seem to be sticking with the expensive brands. You do have the occasional shops that has a lot of options for cheaper vaping. My personal experience with most e-liquid 
I was my pleasure to be on the Lemon episode of Noted tonight sharing my thoughts and notes on 29 different lemons, my favorite lemon recipes, and other ideas. I also ranked them from best to worst in my opinion. I thought I'd share. Recipe I created from my SFT work Bill D. Lemonade ( - A super simple 3 ingredient, 5% flavor, sweet/tart lemonade base without using any lemonade flavors. This has a really natural base up front.

Rough translation: Also, today is March 24th, so it's Otto Suwen's birthday. Being washed away by the first preview for Bonds of Ice and the season two announcement is just like Otto, but Otto's activity will increase explosively after season one, so please Saw there wasn't a setlist in the archive for this one. The audio in the recording archive wasn't the cleanest and it wasn't the full set, but wirh a couple youtube videos I think I got most of the set: "Make some noise" intro loop Bassnectar - Encore (50 Cent - Just a lil bit a cappella) Infuze amp BOT - Analog Ting ("We don't die we multiply") Grimes - Genesis (Bassnectar Remix) Professor Green ft. Lily Allen - Just Be Good To Green (Camo amp Krooked remix) Bassnectar Hello there r/chanceme, I am very anxious about getting into a good college and looking for some suggestions in where to look for colleges that will fit my interests and potential major. Would like to potentially get into good UCs but I know it’s a long shot. School list (as of now): UC Davis, UCLA, UC Berkeley, Stanford, St. Mary’s, Potentially some Ivy’s (Harvard, Princeton). Trying to find safety schools and match schools but early in process as of now. GPA: 4.0 UW 4.8 W on a 5.0 scale. This is gonna be a long post cause it's mostly just general analysis about everything to do with authorities and some small theories that aren't big enough to warrant an individual post just smooshed together. It's mostly my own personal notes but It seemed a waste to not share them cause they were just sitting there from when I was doing the character tier profiles for the witches of sin and the archbishops (I've done a couple now, I'll make them into pdf's and shit in a couple weeks and releas. 
Link to part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/Re\_Zero/comments/arfwve/personal\_authority\_analysis\_notes\_12\_wn/ (https://www.reddit.com/r/Re_Zero/comments/arfwve/personal_authority_analysis_notes_12_wn/) Why do people even read these? Greed (Authority: Echidna) Echidna's version is a type of past sight in that she can view events that have already transpired, giving her a form of nigh omniscience and explaining her vast knowledge. She appears to be able to imbue objects  Here's a playlist of all the songs: https://open.spotify.com/user/trackerseeker/playlist/0NTkvwcdxtechzOjljZxJ9?si=WSKTaTlPS32fU7eFCvXyNQ I listed every song on a studio album, and added songs off the live albums that weren’t recorded anywhere else ( Maserati GT, Born to Be Wild, Kick Out the Jams , Buck’s Boogie and We Gotta Get Out of This Place ) and the two songs from the Bad Channels soundtrack ( Demon’s Kiss and The Horsemen Arrive ) then tried to rank them in order. My criteria. Jakob is the unheralded part of the Demar-Kawhi trade. There are some that say we gave away Kawhi and Danny, and all we got was Demar and nothing else. Some feel we would have been better off getting picks. However, getting Jakob was huge for the Spurs for several reasons. First off, Jakob was 9th overall pick in the 2016 draft. Essentially, he is a lottery pick with out the risk. Anthony Bennet, Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor, Dragen Bender, Marquees Chris, Markele Fultz, Bismack Biymbo, Jimmer. It would be awesome if we were in the same wavelenght, we could inspire each other, but we're not so everything he wants to do feels one sided and not fun for me, it's starting to be a bother when he gets an idea that he wants me to do (because he doesn't have the skills for most of what he wants to do so I'm expected to do the most tedious work). Example: He wants to make his own soap opera. I'm not into that kinda stuff, but I got a bit exited when I gave a few plot ideas and he liked them. A couple of weeks ago, I asked you guys (https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9vtu1j/hello_popheads_lets_rank_lady_gagas_discography/) to help me rate Lady Gaga's songs and after some small stepbacks I present you with r/popheads' ranking of Mother Monster's entire discography. # BUT BEFORE THAT. SOME FAQ How many people participated? 88 people in total Where can I see the results? HERE (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kOBTUafP9lKkzeZ_O9ySnk4mrr758pujPrxaNMN-3O. Hi r/NBA, Inspired by some of the other novelty team posts such as the one that only let teams run players born in that city, I decided to do my own: best “consecutive numbers” teams! Starting with 0,1,2,3,4; I’ve created squads with one player wearing each consecutive number from that group of 5. For simplicity’s sake, I only used active NBA players and used the players’ current form for my consideration (for example, Melo did not make a squad). I also tried not to use injured players 
So I'm (19M) a sophomore in college and she's (18F) a freshman. I've been a part of an a capella group at the University for the 4 semesters I've been here and she just got in this semester. At least I know we have singing in common! We've had some small conversations and jokey banter during rehearsals with other people around. I made her laugh a few times, so hey, that's progress! I'm just terrible at figuring out where to go from there in situations like this. It's especially hard because. I'm a huge fan of 90's dance music and this mix has a lot of songs I have never heard that I would like to add to my playlist. Can anyone help me identify them? Ideally I would like to identify every song here. If you hear one that you know can you post in this format: Start - End Artist - Song Name e.g. 1:13 - 1:20 Masterboy - I Got To Give It Up https://www.facebook.com/DJ.Mixes.Now/videos/vb.559032997463088/1907735222592852/?type=2amptheater Youtube version: https://www.youtube. Bored as fuck, pfft where did the one every two day chapters go? it's almost like Tappei has to sleep or something, I kid of course but I'm seriously hype as fuck for the gluttony arc, I'd hazard a guess and say 20 more chapters and then we're on to arc 7. So pretty straightforward, 1-10 tiering. 1-3 is low tier, 4-6 is mid, 7-9 is high and 10 is god-tier, ? is for characters we have little to no information on and ?? is for those that have game breaker abilities and X is for literal Hello all. I'm looking to start a smallish (12-36 member) choir out of Central/Northern Westchester. May be called the Bedford Singers or something like that in order to gain access to free rehearsal space at the local community center. I'm thinking something like SATB or SSATB or even SSAATTBB if I had enough voices. I was hoping for primarily classical, maybe some thorny jazz arrangements of pop songs or American Standards. Largely a Capella, but I'm not opposed to accompanied pieces. 
Hey All, amp#x200B; So I've got some questions, or some things to reflect on. I am in my late 30's and in my first year as an ICU nurse. I originally pursued nursing as my second career because I want to feel like I was contributing to society rather than taking from it as I felt I did in my former life. When I started nursing school, and clinicals, I noticed immediately that nursing was far understaffed, underpaid, and overworked. I also felt like I was being taught bare safety-level concep. Hello, ~~I am going to order the advanced DIY kit from vapewild, they offer 6 flavors with it and I am wondering which of these you all recommend.~~ I don't generally like strong custards or creams. And tend to like fruity vapes a lot more. Thank you for the insight. Edit: as per recommendation, no longer going with vapewild, and also understand a kit isn't a recommendation either. I simply chose it as it was cheaper on that site in particular. It also seems that the TFA flavors Hey all, it's my first time with Novavapes, so I decided to do a little review of liquids and general impressions about the buying process. I vape for pleasure - I like trying new tastes. Nicotine is secondary. I vape since 2013, I spend around 60Eur a month on average on e-liquids, point being - I tried quite a number of them, produced both in EU, USA and Asia. I found this company on Reddit and decided to try the 600ml Original Pack, plus 120 Strawberry Milkshake. So, the order With the regular season now done and dusted I decided it would be cool to take a look back at every NBA team this season and place them into tiers on the level that they have performed at this season. Of course every situation is different and so I have factored in the teams overall win-loss record but also how they have responded to difficult situations this season such as injuries or the context of how they have performed. This is just my opinion and I am keen to shuffle Dear friend I left behind, Some oddly coincidental things happened today. I woke up this morning from a dream about you meeting my new friends. Then I had a panic attack with my head full of you and everything we used to do. Then I crashed and saw you in a dream again. When I woke up, I got a notification from discord that you left a group we used to be in together. I forget if you believe in fate or not, but I swear that this was me feeling us tearing further apart. It's weird trying 
So I started learning FL about 3 years ago, having reached the limits of the Maschine software (with a burnt out controller - but the libraries are so great). At the same time, I learned sound design by using Massive, and I got pretty good at getting what I wanted out of Reaktor, too (enough to know that I'll never have enough time to master it, lol). The last serious audio recording I ever did was with a Tascam 8-track cassette deck in a garage apartment, and hanging blankets # Hey guys, We have some big banners coming around the corner. Unfortunately, you know as well as I do that those precious gems are a limited resource! For those of you who are on the fence about which of these banners to pull on, this post is dedicated to talking through some of the pros and cons of each banner so that you can hopefully get a better idea of what you want to do. Alright, here are the banners themselves: Lost Chapter #2 Banner – ETA: Thursday, June 28 Featuring: Tidus. In light of what looks to be an epic Western Conference Finals between two stacked juggernaut, I wanted to highlight a few key relationships that makes this hotly anticipated. We all knew this was coming. Let's do it. The Rockets and Warriors have been the best teams all season. Warriors have been coasting after a 16-1 epic, all time playoff run. The Rockets came out of the regular season with statement wins in the heads up matchup and the best record in the league. The Warriors 网易云音乐是一款专注于发现与分享的音乐产品，依托专业音乐人、dj、好友推荐及社交功能，为用户打造全新的音乐生活。.
